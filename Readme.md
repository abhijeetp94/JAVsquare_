# Crypto Web
Problem There are various types of data that our phone or any other storage device stores .but sometimes we all have some security issues in saving data. On the other hand storing that data in a different folder or some secrete place can never solve this insecurity problem. Solution This project consist of the development of a web application to secure data of a user by using cryptography and steagnography Cryptography and steganography techniques are more popular now a day's for data security..we’ll encrypt the data of user and provide him a key and will save the msg and the key on database.

Advantages

• This project will allow user to have his own profile where he can upload any kind of file whether it is text,image or any other format .

• The stored image file is completely secured, as the file is being encrypted not by just using one but more than one encryption algorithm.

• Data is kept secured which avoids unauthorized access.

• The key will also be secure as it will embedded in image using image stegnography

This project will allow users to store data in a secure manner without facing the problem of data attack. In future the use of hybrid algorithms will increases the level of encryption of encrypted mobile data and also reduces the time required for encryption and decryption.

Tech stack

• Html, css, javascript for frontend

• Django,php and python for backend.

• virtual environment through atom, anaconda, window powershell

• Github
